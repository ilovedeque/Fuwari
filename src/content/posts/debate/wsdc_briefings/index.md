# Points of Information (POI)

* A POI is a short interjection from a speaking member of the other team to the speaker on your team holding the floor. 
* Speakers can only give POIs between the first and seventh minute of the speech.

:::warning
Time allowed for POIs can vary based on the tournament.

## Taking POIs

* Speaker who has the floor has a right to refuse POIs, but in general should accept about 2 POIs.
* If a speaker accepts a POI, they should give the person offering the POI adequate time to express their comment (maximum of 15 seconds).

## Offering POIs

* Only one speaker from the opposing speaking team can offer a POI at a time.
* Non-speaking members of the opposing speaking team may not offer any POIs.
* When offering POIs, speaker should not indicate the topic of their POI, e.g. by saying “on that point”.
* If a POI is rejected, they should wait ~20 secs before offering another. Badgering the speaker is poor form and is inequitable conduct.

## What happens if a speaker takes no POIs/fewer than 2 POIs?

* The decision of the overall round, regardless of the POIs taken by speakers, should be evaluated by the content coming out in the round.
* However, teams that take POIs are advantaged by being able to engage the other team’s material more. Moreover, judges can reflect in an individual speaker’s score the fact that they took no POIs.
* In very close circumstances, not taking POIs can reflect poor strategy and an unwillingness to engage.
